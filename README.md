# bambooflow

First make the hollow pipe, then let the water flow~

## Why bambooflow?

🐍 Pure Python core and framework-agnostic, like [dataflow](https://github.com/tensorpack/dataflow)<br>
🤹 Asynchronous and concurrency first, akin to [pypeln](https://github.com/cgarciae/pypeln)<br>
⛓️ Composable dot-chain functional syntax, from [torchdata](https://github.com/pytorch/data)<br>
🎍 Together, multi-tasking cooperatively, this is bambooflow!
